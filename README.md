# SOHO-Project
SOHO Project I created to explore the Cisco Packet Tracer program
So here's the breakdown of this project...

Gleton Enterprises is a fast-growing company in Detroit, Michigan with more than 2 million customers globally. The company deals with manufacturing and selling of auto parts, which are operated from the headquarters. The company intends to open a branch in Pontiac, Michigan. Thus, the company requires young IT graduates to design the network for the branch. The network is intended to operate separately from the HQ network. Being a small network, the company has the following requirements during implementation; 
 

- 🛜 One router and one switch are to be used (all CISCO products). 🛜
- 👩🏽‍💻 3 departments (Admin/IT, Finance/HR, and Customer Service/Reception). 👩🏽‍💻
- 🧑🏾‍💼 Each department is required to be in different VLANS. 🧑🏾‍💼
- 👔 Each department is required to have a wireless network for the users. 👔
- 🖨️ Host devices in the network are required to obtain IPv4 addresses automatically. 🖨️
- 🗄️ Devices in all the departments are required to communicate with each other. 🗄️

Assume the ISP gave out a base network of 192.168.1.0, as the young network engineer who has been hired, designed, and implement a network considering the above requirements. 
 

👨🏽‍💻Technologies Implemented👨🏽‍💻: 

- Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch. 
- Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling. 
- Creating VLANs and assigning ports VLAN numbers. 
- Subnetting and IP Addressing. 
- Configuring Inter-VLAN Routing (Router on a stick). 
- Configuring DHCP Server (Router as the DHCP Server). 
- Configuring WLAN or wireless network (Cisco Access Point). 
- Host Device Configurations. 
- Test and Verifying Network Communication.
